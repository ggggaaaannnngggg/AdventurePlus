# AdventurePlus

This is my mod for Minecraft 1.2.5 that expands minecraft in a direction I think would be better than what modern Minecraft did. This intro will be expanded soontm.


How To Install:


1)Make sure you have Java 8 installed (newer versions will probably death, and only 8 is supported)

2A)If you are using a version, in-20200727 or older: download ModLoader: https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader?gvsn=

2B)If you are using a version, 1.3 TEST BUILD 1 or newer and not using MultiMC: download Forge: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.2.5.html

2C)If you are using multimc, click "Install Forge" on a Minecraft 1.2.5 instance

3)Add the loader you just downloaded (if you did not follow step 2C) to minecraft.jar, THEN add Adventure+ to minecraft.jar.
