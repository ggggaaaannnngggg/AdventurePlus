# AdventurePlus

This is my mod for Minecraft 1.2.5 that expands minecraft in a direction I think would be better than what modern Minecraft did. This intro will be expanded soontm.


How To Install:


1)Make sure you have Java 8` update 291 at latest installed (newer versions tend to have problems with ModLoader/Forge and recent Java 8 updates have been found to be unstable). Java 5 - 7 will probably work but only 8 under and including update 291 is supported. Support for newer Java versions is planned.

2A)If you are using a version, in-20200727 or older: download ModLoader: https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader?gvsn=

2B)If you are using a version, 1.3 TEST BUILD 1 or newer and not using MultiMC: download Forge: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.2.5.html

2C)If you are using a version, 1.3 TEST BUILD 1 or newer and are using MultiMC, click "Install Forge" on a Minecraft 1.2.5 instance

3)Add the loader you just downloaded (if you did not follow step 2C) to minecraft.jar, THEN add Adventure+ to minecraft.jar.

NOTE: For some reason, github randomly started to sort release tags alphabetically, so when looking for the latest release, use the tags tab and not the releases tab.
