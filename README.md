# AdventurePlus

Adventure+ is a 1.2.5 mod I have been working on sporadically since April 2020, with the goal of expanding on, improving and overhauling Minecraft shortly after the Adventure Update to become my ideal version of modern Minecraft. This is just a place to host releases for now, the actual repo is private because it contains decompiled mc code.

Features:

-Overhauled world generation: Explore a variety of terrain generation up to y = 256 (192 blocks above sea level) with mountain ranges, plains, rolling hills, oceans, plateaus, islands etc.
-New biome system similar to beta's system but with much more capability, being able to depend on terrain generation noise and also alter terrain generation. Also variates decoration with noise which produces more unique environments everywhere you go.
-Micromanagement-free Stamina system for sprinting as well as Hunger and Classic (no hunger or stamina) if you don't want that.
-New world types and themes similar to Indev.
-Singleplayer commands
-Lightmap customization and paged video settings.
-New blocks including ceramic, dyed bricks, redstone glass lamps, redstone surface lamps and candles
-Finished colored wood types including stairs, slabs, pressure plates, and bookshelves.
-Brighter feel and Beta textures.

Planned Features:

-Seasons and weather overhaul.
-Material-based enchanting. Find magic items to enchant tools with instead of xp.
-More structures/bosses to adventure to (can tie in with material system).
-Corlored lighting (as in different blocks can have different colors).
-New Implementation of rivers.
-Possibly cubic chunks/extended world height and some things to tie in with that such as skylands or more to explore underground.
