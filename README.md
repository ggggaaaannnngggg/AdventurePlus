# AdventurePlus

Adventure+ is a 1.2.5 mod I have been working on sporadically since April 2020, with the goal of expanding on, improving and overhauling Minecraft shortly after the Adventure Update to become my ideal version of modern Minecraft. Currently undergoing a rewrite to clean up the codebase and cut some content that does not fit the current vision of the mod.

How To Install:


1)Make sure you have Java 8` update 291 at latest installed (newer versions tend to have problems with ModLoader/Forge and recent Java 8 updates have been found to be unstable). Java 5 - 7 will probably work but only 8 under and including update 291 is supported. Support for newer Java versions is planned.

2A)If you are using a version, in-20200727 or older: download ModLoader: https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader?gvsn=

2B)If you are using a version, 1.3 TEST BUILD 1 or newer and not using MultiMC: download Forge: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.2.5.html

2C)If you are using a version, 1.3 TEST BUILD 1 or newer and are using MultiMC, click "Install Forge" on a Minecraft 1.2.5 instance

3)Add the loader you just downloaded (if you did not follow step 2C) to minecraft.jar, THEN add Adventure+ to minecraft.jar.

NOTE: For some reason, github randomly started to sort releases by tags alphabetically, so the order they appear in the releases tab does not reflect the order they were released.
